## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
install.packages("HistData") 
library(HistData)              
data(arbuthnot)                

```


```{r}
dim(arbuthnot)
```
```{r}
names(arbuthnot)
```
```{r}
View(arbuthnot$girls)
```



```{r}
print(arbuthnot$girls)
```
## a simple plot of the number of girls
baptized per year with the command

```{r}
plot(x = arbuthnot$year, y = arbuthnot$girls, type ="l")
```
```{r}
arbuthnot$boys + arbuthnot$girls
```
##  plot of the total number of baptisms per year with the command
```{r}
plot(arbuthnot$year, arbuthnot$boys + arbuthnot$girls, type = "l")
```
```{r}
arbuthnot$boys/(arbuthnot$boys + arbuthnot$girls)
